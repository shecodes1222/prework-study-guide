          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain 2 components:CSS Property and Value Property.</li>
          <li>Link elements creats the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>

          <li>Using the box-shadow method you can set multiple effects separated by commas.</li>
          <li>box-shadow property is described by x and y offsets relative to the element, blur, spread radius, and color.</li>
          <li>The X offset defines the width or extent of the shadow on the x-axis (or to the right of the box).</li>
          <li>The Y offset defines the extent on the y-axis (or just below the box).</li>
          <li>we style elements using the class attribute .card</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches.</li>
          <li>git add -A will stage your changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "<your message here>" is important especially when collaborating with other fellow developers.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main command is to ensure once changes are added and commited locally, your local branch is up to date before pushing up your changes.</li>
          <li>git push origin "<nameofbranch>" command will push up changes to the remote repository.</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>High level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
        <li>One of its core features is variables, which store data types as values.</li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li> Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>Conditional statements allow us to interrupt the control flow.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data that is related in some way.</li>
        <li>Arrays can store different types of data (string, number, Boolean values).</li>
        <li>In JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
        <li>Loops use a predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items in a array.</li>
        <li> Length is a built in property of an array.</li>
        <li> A declaration uses a var keyword to declare a variable.</li>
        <li>Functions are used to control when the code executes.</li>
        <li>Functions are building blocks of JS.</li>
        <li>Functions group a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a task.</li>
        <li>Functions must be defined and called</li>
        <li>math.floor() and math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built in math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
