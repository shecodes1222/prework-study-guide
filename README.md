# Prework Study-Guide

## Description
This project is a study guide to the Prework you will need to complete for the bootcamp! I hope this is as helpful to you as it was to me.


- My motivation for this project was to help fellow beginner coders in their bootcamp journey.
- I built this project to make studying HTML,CSS, and JavaScript a little easier.
- This study guide will help students in the bootcamp by highlighting key information about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- I learned that a strong foundation is important and a good sense of organization and time management will be your best friend! But, I also learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all connected!
